EchoText is a compact assistive tool designed to read such information aloud using OCR and Text-to-Speech (TTS). The system simplifies daily activities, enhances independence, and reduces reliance on others for product-related information.

## Introduction

Many visually challenged individuals struggle with everyday tasks that rely heavily on reading printed information. Critical details like expiry dates on food items, nutritional values, and medicine labels are often printed in small fonts and inconsistent formats, making them extremely difficult to access without assistance.


## The problem we’re hoping to solve :


### Product packaging contains important details that directly affect health and safety, yet:
- Expiry dates are printed in small, low-contrast fonts.
- Nutrition tables are dense and hard to parse even for sighted readers.
- Medicine labels contain critical dosage schedules and warnings.
- No affordable, easy-to-use assistive tool exists for quick, on-the-spot reading.
- Existing apps rely fully on OCR, which fails on small, distorted text.
- Visually challenged users currently depend on others for verification, which reduces privacy, independence, and confidence.
- Echo Text aims to solve this accessibility gap with a portable, low-cost reading aid.

## Objectives 
- To design a portable assistive device or app that reads printed product information aloud.
- To implement OCR for general text detection but enhance it with official databases for accurate and structured results.
- To extract and prioritize critical information (expiry date, nutrition summary, medicine name, dosage).
- To create a simple, hands-free voice or button-based interface.
- To keep the system affordable for real-world use.
